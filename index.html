            This is an example of a notebook written in [Kajero](https://github.com/JoelOtter/kajero).

            It's got a line break and everything.

            ```python
            print "This is a Python block. It's not runnable, here."
            ```

            ```javascript
            var sum = 0;
            window.number = 1000;
            "Sum is " + sum + ", number is " + window.number;
            ```

            ```javascript
            var sum = 0;
            for (var i = 0; i <= number; i++) {
                sum += i * i;
            }
            "The sum of all squared up to " + window.number + " is: " + sum;
            ```

            ```javascript
            window.number += 50;
            "Set number to " + window.number;
            ```
