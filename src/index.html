            This is an example of a notebook written in [Kajero](https://github.com/JoelOtter/kajero).

            It's got a line break and everything.

            ```python
            print "This is a Python block. It's not runnable, here."
            ```

            ```javascript
            console.log("This is a JS block. We'll have lots of fun here.");
            ```

            * BPs
